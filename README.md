## How I Made It

The Mindfulness Tip Generator was created using basic web development technologies:

1. **HTML5**: Structured the layout and elements of the web pages, including the main tip generator interface and the journaling page.
   
2. **CSS3**: Styled the application to enhance visual appeal and ensure a pleasant user experience. This includes layout design, color schemes, typography, and responsive design for different screen sizes.
   
3. **JavaScript**: Implemented the core functionality of the application:
   - Randomly selecting and displaying mindfulness tips.
   - Managing journal entries using browser storage (localStorage).
   - Handling user interactions such as button clicks and navigation between pages.
   
4. **Local Storage**: Utilized browser storage (localStorage) to store journal entries locally on the user's device. This allows users to revisit their journal entries even after closing or refreshing the page.
